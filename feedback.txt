Hello Dmitry,

I have reviewed your Django project and here is the feedback:

- Your project structure and file organization are commendable. Creating the 'management' folder as a subfolder in the main app is an effective approach to separating concerns.

- The readability and formatting of your code are on point.

- You've shown impressive utilization of Django and Django REST Framework features. Your JavaScript integration stands out.

- Your database modeling shows a clear understanding of the structure, although I noticed that you've started creating a custom User within an app that ideally shouldn't be responsible for authentication. It would be a good idea to create a separate app for this purpose.

- Your views and URL design are well-crafted, which enhances the user experience and overall usability of the project.

- On the error handling and validation, it's crucial to have some form of checks and balances to cater for edge cases. Consider using validations on your models/serializers and perhaps a try-except clause.

- Lastly, I would strongly recommend improving your documentation. Documenting functions, classes, and other elements of your codebase will make it more understandable for others who might want to contribute or use it.

Overall, your project displays a deep understanding of Django development. Just keep the above feedback in mind and continue refining your skills.

Best regards,
Yossi.
